We envision three types of participants, as illustrated in \Cref{fig:cicada-explainer}:
\begin{description}
    \item[Users.] We simply refer to voters or bidders as \emph{users}. Users submit bids or ballots, which we generically call \emph{submissions}. We assume some external process to establish the set of authorized users (which may be open to all).  Once users place their submissions, no further action is required of them. 
    \item[On-chain coordinator.] We refer to the tallier/auctioneer as the \emph{coordinator}, typically implemented as a smart contract that collects submissions. The coordinator transparently calculates the winner(s). In the case of an auction, they might also transfer (digital) assets to the winner(s). In an election, they might grant special privileges to the winner.%'s public key.
    \item[Off-chain solver.] We assume an untrusted \emph{solver} who unlocks the final (set of) HTLP off-chain and submits the solution(s) to the coordinator with a proof of correct opening. In principle, this could be any party, but in practice will likely be one of the parties participating in (or administering) the vote/auction or a paid marketplace~\cite{EPRINT:Abadi23,CCS:TGBKS21}.
