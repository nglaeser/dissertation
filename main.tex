\begin{abstract}
Blockchains were introduced in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto as a way to implement a trusted but decentralized append-only ledger. This simple functionality has given rise to a plethora of decentralized applications utilizing the blockchain as a public bulleting board. In recent years, it has become clear that this basic functionality is not enough to prevent widespread attacks on both the privacy and security of blockchain users, as evidenced by the blockchain analytics industry and the billions of dollars stolen via cryptocurrency exploits to date. This work explores the role cryptography has to play in the blockchain ecosystem to both enhance user privacy and secure user funds.

% Blockchains are inherently public, [but sometimes we want privacy. We need to use crypto to do this. And so on and so forth\dots] \noemi{actually probably need to expand to also include ``security'', since the threshold sigs project isn't really about privacy}
% A key challenge in [my area of research] is [problem I halfway figured out how to solve]. (And so on and so forth\dots)

\section{Privacy-Enhancing Building Blocks}\label{sec:building-blocks}

Although cryptocurrencies are often treated as fully anonymous digital currencies, numerous works have shown how to link transactions or even fully deanonymize users in many popular cryptocurrencies \cite{CCS:BirKhoPus14,EuroSP:BirTik19,FC:KosKosMcD14,PoPETS:MSHLHSHHMNC18,USENIX:KYMM18}. Numerous mitigations have been suggested, including cryptocurrency mixers (described below) and privacy-first cryptocurrencies like Zcash~\cite{zcash} and Monero~\cite{monero}.
