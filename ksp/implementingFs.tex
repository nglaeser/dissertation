\subsection{Trustless Proactive Refresh Using a Bulletin-Board}\label{sec:fs_protocol}

Recall from \Cref{subsec:enc_pok} that the correctness of our proactive refresh protocols relies on the update polynomial $z_\timeT(X)$ being of degree $t-1 \leq d$ and having $z_\timeT(0)=0$. 
We can use a folklore technique~\cite[\S2.5]{EC:CHMMVW20} 
% First, in addition to the elements $\{g_1, g_1^\tau, g_1^{\tau^2}, \dots, g_1^{\tau^n}, g_2, g_2^\tau\}$, the CRS will include $\{g_1^\alpha, g_1^{\alpha\tau}, g_1^{\alpha\tau^2}, \dots, g_1^{\alpha\tau^t}, g_2^\alpha\}$ where $\alpha \sample \ZZ_p$ is a second trapdoor. Second,
% in addition to verifying their update share $z_\timeT(i)$ with the evaluation proof $\pi_{\timeT,i}'$, the hot storages verify 
to enforce the degree requirement: the client publishes an additional public ``degree commitment'' $\dcom_\timeT := g_1^{\tau^{d-t+1} \cdot z_\timeT(\tau)}$, %g_1^{\alpha z_\timeT(\tau)}$
which is verified by checking
\[
    e(\dcom_\timeT, g_2) = e(\ucom_\timeT, g_2^{\tau^{d-t+1}}), %g_2^\alpha),
\]
where $d$ is the degree of the KZG CRS. This ensures that the polynomial $z_\timeT(X)$ committed to by $\ucom_\timeT$ is of degree at most $t-1$. To enforce the evaluation at zero, $C$ can simply provide a KZG opening proof for $\ucom_\timeT$ at $X=0$.

Additionally, the hot parties should also be sure that the client is using the \emph{same} polynomial $z_\timeT(X)$ for all of them when computing their share updates $\delta_i$. This is easily done, since each $P_i^\hot$ is already provided with an evaluation proof $\zopen_i$ for $\delta_i$. In the case of a trusted client, these were assumed to be computed correctly so $P_i^\hot$ only used them to blindly update the its key share and opening proof $(\hx_i, \pi_i)$. In the case of an untrusted client, parties will instead first check their correctness by ensuring $\mathsf{KZG}.\vrfy(\crs, \ucom_\timeT, i, \delta_i, \zopen_i) = 1$, and only update their key share and opening proof if verification passes.

% \noemi{Alternatively can include commitments to the encrypted shares in $C$'s public key and each $P_i^\hot$ proves knowledge of the contents}

\input{ksp/protocols/pi-ref}

\Cref{fig:pi_ref} gives the proof system $\Pi_{\sf Ref}$ used to prove correctness of share refreshes, with verification split between verifying the well-formedness of the update polynomial $z_\timeT(X)$ committed to by ${\sf u}\com_\timeT$ (via ${\sf UC}\vrfy$) and of each hot party's refresh information $\delta_i$ (via ${\sf H}\vrfy$).

Given $\Pi_{\sf Ref}$, it is fairly simple to realize $\Fs$ in a manner that avoids trusting $C$ except for the setup phase.
To do this, we assume a public bulletin board functionality $\Fbb$ with limited programmability (\Cref{fig:Fbb}). This functionality will store the most up-to-date commitment $\com$ to the hot shares $\hx_1, \dots, \hx_n$. Whenever the shares are refreshed, it will also check the correctness of the update to $\com$ (namely $\ucom$) before making the new commitment available.

Specifically, instead of only running the steps of $\Fs$ locally, $C$ will compute some additional values using $\Pi_{\sf Ref}$ to let $\Fbb$ and each $P_i^\hot$ check the correctness of the share and update commitments. 
The proof for the update commitment $\ucom$ will be checked by $\Fbb$ before updating the stored commitment. 
Additionally, $C$ will let $\Fbb$ store and distribute $\ucom$ instead. 
We describe the full protocol in \Cref{fig:fs_protocol}. %where changes with respect to locally running the ideal functionality $\Fs$ are shown in \chblue{blue}.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:fs-protocol}
The encrypted secret sharing protocol in \Cref{fig:fs_protocol} UC-realizes $\Fs$ in the $\Fbb$-hybrid model.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Let $\adv$ be the adversary interacting with the parties $P_1, \dots, P_n, C$ running the protocol in \Cref{fig:fs_protocol}. We will construct a simulator $\Sim$ running in the ideal world so that no environment $\env$ can distinguish an execution of the ideal-world interaction from the real protocol. $\Sim$ will interact with $\Fs$, $\env$, and invoke a copy of $\adv$ to run a simulated interaction of the protocol (which we again refer to as the internal interaction). The dummy parties, communication tapes, and message delivery are handled in the same way as in the proof of \Cref{thm:sec}.
    
    \paragraph{Corruptions} Whenever $\adv$ corrupts a party $P_i$ in the internal execution, $\Sim$ corrupts the corresponding dummy party.

    \paragraph{Setup and auxiliary information} Since all the computation in setup is done by $C$ and we do not allow it to be corrupted in this phase, $\Sim$ only passes messages to and from $\Fs$. It also keeps track of client-threshold pairs in a list $D'$. Similarly, retrieving auxiliary information involves no computation, so $\Sim$ again only passes along messages.

    \paragraph{Generating share refreshes} If $C$ is corrupt, $\Sim$ retrieves $(C, t) \in D'$ and observes what values $\ucom, \pi_\ucom$ the adversary $\adv$ sends to $\Fbb$ in the internal interaction. It computes $b^* \gets \Pi_{\sf Ref}.\mathsf{UC}\vrfy((\crs, \ucom, t), \pi_\ucom)$. When $\Fs$ sends $\Sim$ a $\mathsf{ZeroSetupRequest}$ message, it responds with $b^*$.

    $\Sim$ also keeps track of the values $(x_i, \zopen_i)$ sent by $\adv$ to each $P_i$ in the internal interaction and computes $b_i^* \gets \Pi_{\sf Ref}.\mathsf{H}\vrfy((\crs, \ucom, i, x_i), \zopen_i)$. When $\Fs$ sends $\Sim$ a $\mathsf{ZeroShareRequest}$ message, it responds with $b_i^*$.
