Blokh et al.~\cite{EPRINT:BloMakPel22} describe another threshold signing protocol which combines online (hot) and offline (cold) parties. Their protocol is tailored to ECDSA signatures and uses $n$ hot parties and single cold party. These $(n+1)$ parties are independent (i.e., the cold party is not paired with any hot party, as in our setting); thus, their security guarantee is still a classic $t$-out-of-$n$ threshold guarantee, unlike our protocol, which is secure up to corruption of $t$ \emph{pairs}. Furthermore, in their protocol, hot parties engage in MPC to generate a pre-signature, which is then finalized and output by the cold party. This is in contrast to our protocol, where the cold parties send messages to their corresponding hot parties, and the \emph{hot} parties output the final signature (or signature shares).
